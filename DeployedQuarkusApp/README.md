# Quarkus App on Kubernetes and OpenShift

This task required me to deploy this Quarkus app to Kubernetes and OpenShift. This only shows the Quarkus app. Go to https://hub.docker.com/r/ysahu/sample-app to pull the Docker container. See DeployCommands.md for the commands to deploy this app. This is still a work in progress.
