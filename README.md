# Google-CodeIn - 2019-2020 Season

Hello! This is where I put my projects for the Google Code-in tasks that I completed during the 2019-2020 season. Each task is separated by a folder.

My username is CodeNinja. This season, I completed 7 tasks for the JBoss Community. They are listed below:

1. I completed the Learn Git Branching task, which required me to complete all of the levels of a Git Branching game. The link to the game is: http://learngitbranching.js.org/. This was a beginner task. I did not have to submit any code for this task.

2. I completed the simple HTTP web server task, which required me to create a simple HTTP server in Java. The code for this is in the SimpleHTTPServer folder, along with a short description. This was also a beginner task.

3. I completed the Java OOP Examples task, which required me to create examples demonstrating various features of OOP in Java. This included examples of abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. There are explanations for these concepts in the code as well as in a seperate markdown file. The code for this is in the JavaOOPExamples folder.

4. I completed the C/C++ Makefile task, which required me to make a makefile that would compile and run a C or C++ (I chose C++) program that would print your username. To use, you simply type 'make' into the command prompt (feel free to change the code as well). The code for this is in the CPPMakefile folder.

5. I completed the React JS Game task, which required me to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. In this game, one is able to reverse their moves, and it includes an unusual win condition (if a player owns the top left, center, and bottom left corners, it counts it as a win) as per the requirements of the task. The code for this is in the ReactJSGame folder.

6. I completed the Quarkus Random Name Generator, which required me to create a Quarkus app that would give you a random name upon hitting the endpoint '/randomname'. To use, simply run 'mvn compile quarkus:dev' in the sample-app directory and launch localhost:<port>/randomname where <port> is the port specified in the command prompt output. The code for this is in the QuarkusRandomNameGenerator folder.

Before claiming the next task, I claimed a task which required me to deploy a Quarkus app to Kubernetes and OpenShift. Due to several errors, I was unable to complete the task and was forced to abandon. The task description is at this link: https://codein.withgoogle.com/tasks/4801033146990592/?sp-search=quarkus.

7. I completed the Go URL Shortener task, which required me to create a Go program that would check the path and redirect to another web page. The code, along with usage instructions, is in the GoURLShortener folder.

Overall, I completed 7 tasks for the JBoss Community and was labeled as one of the community leaders for this organization.
